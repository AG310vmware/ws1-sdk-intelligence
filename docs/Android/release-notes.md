What's in the Release NotesÂ¶
Workspace ONE SDK for Android Release Notes describe the new features and enhancements in each release. This page contains a summary of the new capabilities, issues that have been resolved, and known issues that have been reported in each release. The Workspace ONE SDK for Android is a set of tools that incorporates Workspace ONE UEM functionality into custom-built, for Android applications.

## Workspace ONE SDK 24.6.0 for Android - July 2024

### Minimum Requirements

- Android 5.0 or later
- API Level 21 or later
- Workspace ONE UEM Console 2109 or later
- Android Studio with the Gradle Android Build System (Gradle) 8.2.2 or later

### New Features

- Opt-Int and Out status APIs have been refactored to separate SDK and Telemetry Feature interaction.
- The following have been added or refactored in the Crittercism singleton:

```JAVA
Refactored:
// Used to get/set SDK Opt-In / Opt-Out Status
void setOptInStatus(Crittercism.TelemetryType telemetryType, boolean optIn) -> void setSdkOptInStatus(boolean optIn)
boolean getOptInStatus(Crittercism.TelemetryType telemetryType) -> boolean getSdkOptInStatus()
Added:
// Used to get/set Telemetry Feature Opt-In Status
boolean getTelemetryOptInStatus(TelemetryFeature)
// Used to Opt-Out of all Telemetry Features
void telemetryOptOut();
```

- New API introduced to export data collected through our Telemetry Features!
Users are now able to export data collected from the Telemetry Features they have Opted-Into. Use the following API to get Feature, Event, and Export formatted specific data in an Asynchronous fashion!

```JAVA
  /**
  * Interface for handling Telemetry Feature exported data.
  */
  interface TelemetryExportHandler {
      /**
      * Callback when data export has completed.
      * @param data String which will contain exported Telemetry Feature data,
      * null if error occurs.
      */
      fun onDataExport(data: String?)
  }
  /**
    * Asynchronously Export Data collected through enabled Telemetry Features.
    * @param feature Telemetry Feature to query data for.
    * @param eventType Type of Telemetry Event data to query for: Attributes, Events, or All.
    * @param exportType Format of the data exported, currently offering JSON support only.
    * @param dataHandler Interface called when data is ready to be exported.
    */
  public static void exportTelemetryFeatureData( @NonNull TelemetryFeature feature,
                                                  @NonNull TelemetryEventType eventType,
                                                  @NonNull TelemetryExportType exportType,
                                                  @NonNull TelemetryExportHandler dataHandler) 
  Example: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  // Implement the TelemetryExportHandler Interface to reach exported data asynchronously.
  val dataHandler = object:TelemetryExportHandler { 
    // Callback method for export. Data parameter will either have formatted Telemetry
    // data or be null if an issue occurs. 
    override fun onDataExport(data: String?) {
        Log.d(TAG, "Here is my exported data: ${data ?: "An issue has occurred."}")
      } 
  }
  Crittercism.exportTelemetryFeatureData(
            TelemetryFeature.All, // Query data from all enabled features.
            TelemetryEventType.ALL, // Returns values for all data types.
            TelemetryExportType.JSON, // Format to export data in.
            dataHandler) // Exported data handler callback.
```

### Resolved Issues

none

### Known Issues

none

## Workspace ONE SDK 24.3.1 for Android - March 2024

### Minimum Requirements

- Android 5.0 or later
- API Level 21 or later
- Workspace ONE UEM Console 2109 or later
- Android Studio with the Gradle Android Build System (Gradle) 4.1.3 or later
- Workspace ONE Intelligent Hub for Android version 21.9 or later.

### New Features

none

### Resolved Issues

- Fixed an issue where interacting with the SDK's API's immediately after initializing IntelligenceSDK was causing the events to not be sent to the Intelligence backend.

### Known Issues

- Android Devices Below SDK version level 23 instrumenting WebViews will not be able to report HTTP errors in their Network Insights,  this is due to the following APIs not being supported previous to Android Marshmallow (23):
  - onReceivedHttpError(WebView, WebResourceRequest, WebResourceResponse)
  - onReceivedError(WebView, WebResourceRequest, WebResourceError)

## Workspace ONE SDK 24.3.0 for Android - March 2024

### Minimum Requirements

### New Features

- Developers can assign breadcrumbs to a specific userflow using the following API:

```JAVA
Crittercism.leaveUserflowSpecificBreadcrumb(final String userflowName, final String text)
```

!!!Note
    Breadcrumbs not specified under an active userflow will operate on the traditional breadcrumb logic. Tenant Region Reporting will be calculated based on the Crittercism configuration options.

### Resolved Issues

- Computing upload / download speeds are disabled.

### Known Issues

- Android Devices Below SDK version level 23 instrumenting WebViews will not be able to report HTTP errors in their Network Insights,  this is due to the following APIs not being supported previous to Android Marshmallow (23):
  - onReceivedHttpError(WebView, WebResourceRequest, WebResourceResponse)
  - onReceivedError(WebView, WebResourceRequest, WebResourceError)
