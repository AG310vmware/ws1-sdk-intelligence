This object is used to specify various configuration options for Workspace ONE Intelligence SDK.

Once this object is setup, you can pass it to `+[WS1Intelligence enableWithConfig:]` or `WS1Intelligence.enable(with:)`. After Workspace ONE Intelligence SDK is enabled, changes to this object will have no effect.

## Creating a Config

### defaultConfig

Creates a new WS1Config object with the default values for the above properties. You can modify the config values and pass this object into [WS1Intelligence enableWithAppID:config:]

**Declaration**

Objective-C
```C
+ (WS1Config *)defaultConfig
```

Swift

```Swift
class func default() -> WS1Config

```

**Return Value**

Returns WS1Config with default values.

## Network Insights Configuration

### enableServiceMonitoring ***Property***

Determines whether automatic collection of network traffic data is enabled in the SDK.

If this flag is set to NO, then no instrumentation will be installed and no data will be collected or sent automatically.

Default value: YES (enabled)

**Declaration**

Objective-C
```C
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL enableServiceMonitoring;
```

Swift

```Swift
var enableServiceMonitoring: Bool
```

### monitorNSURLConnection ***Property***

Determines whether Network Insights should automatically capture network performance information for network calls made through NSURLConnection.

Default value: YES

**Declaration**

Objective-C
```C
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL monitorNSURLConnection;
```

Swift

```Swift
var monitorNSURLConnection: Bool
```

### monitorNSURLSession ***Property***

Determines whether Network Insights should automatically capture network performance information for network calls made through NSURLSession.

Default value: YES

**Declaration**

Objective-C
```C
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL monitorNSURLSession;
```

Swift

```Swift
var monitorNSURLSession: Bool
```

### urlFilters ***Property***

An array of WS1Filter objects. These objects are used to fine tune the collection of Network Insights data by the Workspace ONE Intelligence SDK. For example, URLs that may contain sensitive information can be blocked. The filters can also be used to preserve URL query parameters, fragments, and parameters. By default these components are removed from the data reported to the WS1Intelligence hub.

**Declaration**

Objective-C
```C
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSArray <WS1Filter *> *urlFilters;
```

Swift

```Swift
var urlFilters: Array<WS1Filter>
```

## Monitoring Web Views

Workspace ONE Intelligence has the capability to monitor network traffic generated by web views and JavaScript errors generated by WKWebViews.

Monitoring of WKWebView traffic is disabled by default because use of the WKWebView class has the side effect of calling the class initialize method, which creates a new thread to manage webviews.

Since Workspace ONE Intelligence cannot prevent these side effects from happening and many apps do not use webviews, Network Insights for webviews must be explicitly enabled.

### monitorWKWebView ***Property***

Determine whether Network Insights should capture network performance information for network calls made through WKWebView. Currently only page loads and page transitions are captured. Calls made via javascript are currently not captured.

Default value: NO

**Declaration**

Objective-C
```C
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL monitorWKWebView;
```

Swift

```Swift
var monitorWKWebView: Bool
```

## Send Data On Wifi Only

### allowsCellularAccess ***Property***

Determines whether the client will send data to Workspace ONE Intelligence while on a cellular network.

Default value: YES

**Declaration**

Objective-C
```C
@property(nonatomic) BOOL allowsCellularAccess;
```

Swift

```Swift
var allowsCellularAccess: Bool
```

## Toggle MACH Exception Capture

### enableMachExceptionHandling ***Property***

Enables or disables MACH exception capturing by the SDK. This allows capturing additional crashes such as stack overflows. Since installing a mach exception handler can interfere with debuggers, this setting will not take effect when a debugger is attached. You may choose to disable mach exception handling if you have code that already handles mach exceptions.

Default value: YES

**Declaration**

Objective-C
```C
@property(nonatomic) BOOL enableMachExceptionHandling;
```

Swift

```Swift
var enableMachExceptionHandling: Bool
```

## DEX Configuration

### entitlements ***Property***

An optional array of WS1Entitlement (app entitlements) constants. The host application should declare any issued entitlements. These affect how the DEX feature operates.

Default value: nil

Allowed values:
- WS1Entitlement.bluetooth
- WS1Entitlement.wifi_info
- WS1Entitlement.multicast

**Declaration**

Objective-C
```C
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSArray<WS1Entitlement *> *entitlements;
```

Swift

```Swift
open var entitlements: [WS1Entitlement]
```

### enableDEX ***Property*** (deprecated)

!!!Note 

	enableDEX is deprecated. Use this API instead: [setOptInStatusForType](ios-dex-opt-in.md#opting-into-dex)

Bool property to enable / disable Digital Employee Experience data. This can be set to true / false only before starting the SDK. Setting this value after starting the SDK is a void operation.

Default value: false

**Declaration**

Objective-C
```C
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL enableDEX;
```

Swift

```Swift
open var enableDEX: Bool
```
